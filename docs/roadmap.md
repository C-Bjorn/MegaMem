# üó∫Ô∏è MegaMem Development Roadmap

This document provides a concise overview of the MegaMem project's evolution, highlighting key achievements and outlining clear future directions.

## ‚úÖ Achieved Milestones

MegaMem has successfully established a robust foundation, delivering powerful integration between Obsidian and advanced knowledge graph capabilities:

*   **Core Plugin Foundation**: Implemented an Obsidian plugin using TypeScript/Svelte, featuring automatic schema discovery by scanning vault patterns and removing manual YAML configuration.
*   **Multi-Database Support**: Achieved compatibility with Neo4j and FalkorDB, offering 18 distinct configurations combining various LLM and embedding provider setups.
*   **Comprehensive MCP Server**: Rebuilt the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch, now providing 8 Graphiti tools for direct graph interaction and 5 Obsidian WebSocket tools for file management.
*   **Custom Ontology Integration**: Enabled custom ontology support with full Pydantic model generation, enhancing flexible data modeling.
*   **FalkorDB Integration**: Successfully integrated FalkorDB, thoroughly resolving RediSearch compatibility challenges.
*   **Advanced Sync Functionality**: Developed a sophisticated sync mechanism supporting temporal knowledge graphs and robust bidirectional synchronization with path-independent tracking (mmuids).
*   **Production Readiness**: Ensured stability through Python bridge packaging fixes and refined the SchemaManager with a single-source-of-truth architecture.
*   **Sequential Sync Groundwork**: Implemented sequential sync, laying groundwork for "Sync on Save" and scheduled sync.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Our focus remains on expanding MegaMem's capabilities while maintaining simplicity and performance:

*   **Production Release**: Prepare for a public GitHub release (versioning per Obsidian guidelines, PR processes) and submission to the Obsidian community plugin repository.
*   **Enhanced LLM Integration**: Explore features such as automatic ontology generation and a built-in chat interface for more interactive AI experiences.
*   **Revenue Models**: Investigate "Pro" features and provide rich vault templates.
*   **Infrastructure**: Prioritize making core sync reliable and schema management intuitive as prerequisites for advanced features like graph visualization.
*   **Advanced Sync Features**: Implement "Sync on Save" and configurable scheduled sync intervals, building on the current sequential sync architecture.
*   **Graph Visualization**: Evaluate and integrate suitable libraries (e.g., d3.js, three.js, cytoscape) to provide an interactive graph view of user knowledge.

We are committed to continuous improvement and agile development. Specific timelines will be announced as features progress.
